Retrieved from https://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Twitterbot/ This listing includes a step-by-step guide towards building a Twitterbot on your Raspberry Pi, which allows you to send tweets from it remotely. Social media has become a major in fluence in today's society because so many people including myself are on it. Twitter is one of the most popular social media platforms out right now, allowing users to post a maximum 280 character-length "tweets" to describe how they are feeling or just what they want to post at the moment. The process to making a Twitterbot mostly includes creating Python scripts to send tweets and accessing the API for the social media conglomerate which makes it very interesting.

Retrieved from https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/raspberry-pi-print-server This listing is a guide towrads building a printer server out of a Raspberry Pi. My house at home always had a printer network, but this offers a different most cost-effective solution towards wirelessly printing from every device. The process includes using an old printer and using a tool called Samba.
